# StockPlanBackend

A personal stock portfolio tracker backend built with Vapor (Swift). This server-side application provides RESTful APIs for managing stock holdings, tracking historical performance, and fetching real-time price data. Designed to pair with a SwiftUI mobile app for a full-stack Swift experience.

## Overview

StockPlanBackend enables you to:
- Track holdings and watchlists with buy/sell prices, dates, and notes
- Draft due diligence notes (thesis, risks, catalysts, links)
- Set base, bear, and bull targets with timeframes and rationale
- Fetch current quotes and daily historical prices from external providers
- Calculate portfolio gains/losses and performance metrics
- Store user data securely with JWT authentication
- Sync data across devices for iOS and macOS clients

## Features

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Accounts and Auth**: Register/login with JWT for secure multi-device access
- **Portfolio and Watchlist**: CRUD holdings and watchlist entries
- **Due Diligence Notes**: Thesis, risks, catalysts, and reference links per stock
- **Targets**: Base/bear/bull price targets with dates and rationale
- **Market Data**: Quotes and daily history from external APIs with caching
- **Broker Sync v1 (CSV Import)**: Export from your broker, then import the CSV in the app to update holdings/watchlist (read-only; no trading)

### Planned Extensions
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket support for live price streaming
- **Price Alerts**: Push notifications via APNS when stocks hit target prices
- **News Integration**: Pull relevant articles/RSS feeds for tracked stocks
- **Earnings Transcripts**: Attach transcript summaries and key metrics for imported stocks
- **Paper Trading**: Simulate trades without real money to test strategies
- **Advanced Analytics**: CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, attribution
- **Expanded Broker Coverage**: More providers and optional trade execution
- **Automation**: Scheduled tasks for daily refresh and data maintenance

## MVP Strategy: CSV First, Broker API Second

> **Recommended approach**: Implement CSV import before tackling broker API integration.

| Factor | CSV Import | Broker API |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | Low - parse standard file | High - OAuth, rate limits, API versioning |
| Dev time | ~1-2 days | ~1-2 weeks |
| Dependencies | None | Broker partnership, API keys, legal review |
| User friction | Manual export/import | One-time auth flow |
| Testing | Local files | Need sandbox/mock |

**Why CSV first?**
1. **Validates the data model** - You'll understand exactly what fields matter before building broker integrations
2. **Delivers value immediately** - Users can start tracking portfolios on day one
3. **Lower risk** - No external API dependencies or breaking changes
4. **Learning opportunity** - Build out the Stock, Watchlist, and Target flows before adding complexity

**Next steps after CSV:**
1. Pick one broker (Interactive Brokers or Alpaca are developer-friendly)
2. Implement OAuth flow
3. Sync holdings on-demand
4. Add scheduled refresh for positions

## Architecture

### Full-Stack Swift Benefits
- **Shared Models**: Use the same `Stock`, `Portfolio`, `User` structs on server and mobile app
- **Type Safety**: Reduce bugs with Swift's strong typing across the entire stack
- **Code Reuse**: Business logic (e.g., portfolio calculations) can be extracted to a shared Swift package

### Tech Stack
- **Server Framework**: Vapor 4.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production) or SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens via Vapor's JWT package
- **External APIs**: HTTP client for stock data providers
- **Deployment**: Docker on Hetzner VPS with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)

## API Endpoints

## CSV Import (MVP): Export from Broker, Import from App

Enable users to keep their StockPlan portfolio in sync by exporting holdings from their broker as a CSV file and importing it directly in the app.

### How it works
1. Export from your broker
   - In your broker platform, export your current positions/holdings as a CSV.
   - Include at minimum: symbol/ticker and quantity (shares).
   - If available, also include: average cost (buy price) and first purchase date.
   - Save the file to your device (Files/iCloud/Downloads).
2. Import from the app
   - In the StockPlan app, go to Settings → Import from Broker (CSV).
   - Select the CSV file. You'll see a quick preview and header mapping.
   - Confirm to upload; the backend validates rows and upserts holdings.

### Accepted CSV format
- Header row required. Header names are case-insensitive; underscores/spaces are ignored.
- Recognized columns (any of the aliases below are accepted):
  - symbol: "symbol", "ticker`
  - shares: "shares", "quantity", "qty`
  - buy_price: "buy_price", "average_cost", "avg_cost", "cost_basis`
  - buy_date: "buy_date", "purchase_date", "opened`
  - notes (optional)
- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-11-15).
- Numbers: use dot as decimal separator (e.g., 1234.56).
- Extra columns are ignored.

Example:

"""
symbol,shares,buy_price,buy_date,notes
AAPL,12,145.30,2023-04-18,Long-term core
MSFT,5,320.00,2024-01-10,
NVDA,2,,,
"""

### Import behavior
- Upsert by (user, symbol):
  - If a holding with the same symbol exists, its shares/buy price/date are updated.
  - If not, a new holding is created.
- Rows with only a symbol (no shares) can be used to populate your watchlist.
- Invalid rows are skipped and reported back with reasons (e.g., missing symbol).

### API (for clients)
- Endpoint: `POST /brokers/import/csv`
- Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: text/csv`
- Body: raw CSV content.

cURL example:

"""
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/csv" \
  --data-binary @holdings.csv \
  http://localhost:8080/brokers/import/csv
"""

### Privacy & safety
- Read-only import: no trading or broker credentials required.
- Only the data you upload (symbols, quantities, prices) is processed.
